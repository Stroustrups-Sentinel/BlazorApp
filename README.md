## An introduction to Blazor @ðŸ”¥

<https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/aspnet/blazor-tutorial/intro>

My experience:

    - it was short and quite low barrier to entry which is nice.
    - i did have some issues but they were just small ones , (i had 
      used small caps and put commas instead of semi colons)
    - coming from react and other component based MVC frameworks i
      would say its nice to pick up.
    - now its time to do another project using "BLAZOR WEBASSEMBLY 
      succinctly" from the syncfusion books, succinctly series.

P.S:

    - im feeling a bit lazy an tied up to edit it and do some 
      exploration with the project (due to the tight schedule
      and tasks list.)
    - but im sure i wont leave it vanilla like this before archiving it
